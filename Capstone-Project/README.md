this is a youtube clone using MERN stack
this is a combination of both front end and backend complete

User Authentication using JWT.
Image storage using Firebase Storage.
Responsive design for mobile(>375px) and desktop.
Rest apis for efficient backend.
lazyloading for faster frontend.
mui icons for overall appeal.

## Configuration

note: for the time being i have included my own atlas db name and password for easy acccess
and will soon be removed (this is only for the ease of eval for TAs)

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Add necessary environment variables to the `.env` file, such as database connection URLs, API keys, or other sensitive data.
3. Add your own MongoDB Atlas URI in the datbase file inside the backend folder.
